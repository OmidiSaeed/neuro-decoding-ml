# neuro-decoding-ml

This repository explores machine learning methods for decoding neural activity from calcium imaging data.
The goal is to create clean, reproducible pipelines from raw data -> preprocessing and feature extraction -> ML models

Source of data:
- Allen Brain Observatory calcium imaging dataset
- Decoding visual stimuli (drifting grating) from neural activity
